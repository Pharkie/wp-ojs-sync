# SEA WordPress ↔ OJS Integration

Integration between the Society for Existential Analysis (SEA) WordPress membership system and Open Journal Systems (OJS) hosting the journal *Existential Analysis*.

## Problem

- **OJS** hosts the journal with built-in paywall and access control
- **WordPress** is the SEA membership system (source of truth for members)
- SEA members should get journal access without buying separately
- Non-members must still be able to buy individual articles/issues via OJS

## Architecture Decision

**Custom OJS plugin + WP plugin.** A small OJS plugin exposes subscription CRUD as REST endpoints (using OJS's own internal classes). A WP plugin calls those endpoints when membership status changes.

This was reached after systematically eliminating alternatives — see [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) for the full decision trail.

### What was eliminated and why

| Approach | Why it's dead |
|---|---|
| OJS REST API sync | API has no subscription endpoints. Not in 3.4, 3.5, or main. |
| OIDC / OpenID SSO | Only solves login, not access. Plugin has unresolved bugs, no 3.5 release, breaks multi-journal. |
| Subscription SSO plugin | Source code audit confirmed it hijacks OJS purchase flow. Non-members can't buy content. |

### How it works

```
Member signs up / renews on WordPress
  → WP plugin calls OJS custom endpoint → subscription created
  → OJS paywall sees subscription → access granted

Member lapses
  → WP plugin calls OJS custom endpoint → subscription expired
  → OJS paywall denies access → shows purchase options

Non-member visits paywalled content
  → No subscription → normal OJS purchase flow (£3 / £25 / £18)
```

## Access Model

| User type | How they access journal content |
|---|---|
| SEA member (current) | Subscription created in OJS via sync; logs into OJS separately |
| Non-member, single article | Buys via OJS paywall (£3) |
| Non-member, current issue | Buys via OJS paywall (£25) |
| Non-member, back issue | Buys via OJS paywall (£18) |
| Lapsed member | Subscription expired in OJS; treated as non-member |

## Key Constraints

- **Over budget, time-sensitive** — ship the simplest thing that works
- **WP is source of truth** — OJS subscriptions are derived, not authoritative
- **OJS paywall must keep working** — non-member purchases are revenue
- **No OJS core modifications** — plugins only
- **No OIDC/OpenID SSO** — only solves login, not access; OJS plugin poorly maintained against 3.5 breaking changes; if it fails, nobody can log into OJS at all

## Tech Stack

- WordPress (PHP) — existing SEA site
- OJS (PHP) — journal hosting (version TBC — 3.5+ preferred)
- Custom OJS plugin — exposes subscription CRUD endpoints
- Custom WP plugin — syncs membership status to OJS
