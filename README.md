# SEA WordPress ↔ OJS Integration

Integration between the Society for Existential Analysis (SEA) WordPress membership system and Open Journal Systems (OJS) hosting the journal *Existential Analysis*.

## The two systems

**WordPress** is SEA's membership site. Members sign up, pay, and manage their accounts here. The membership stack is:

- **Ultimate Member (UM)** — handles user registration, profiles, and roles
- **WooCommerce Subscriptions (WCS)** — handles subscription billing and lifecycle (renewals, cancellations, payment failures)

UM and WCS work together: WCS processes the payment, then the member gets a WP role that UM manages. WCS is the authority on "is this subscription active?"

**OJS (Open Journal Systems)** hosts the journal *Existential Analysis* with a built-in paywall. Non-members can buy individual articles (£3), current issues (£25), or back issues (£18). It's a separate system on a separate server.

## Problem

- SEA members should get journal access automatically — without buying separately on OJS
- Non-members must still be able to buy individual articles/issues via OJS
- The two systems don't talk to each other

## Architecture Decision

**Push-sync:** custom OJS plugin + WP plugin. OJS has no native subscription API, so the OJS plugin exposes subscription CRUD as REST endpoints (using OJS's own internal classes). The WP plugin calls those endpoints in two modes:

1. **Initial bulk sync (~500 existing members):** WP-CLI command reads all active WooCommerce Subscriptions, creates OJS user accounts and subscription records for each member, then sends "set your password" welcome emails. This is how existing members get access at launch.
2. **Ongoing sync (after launch):** WP plugin hooks into WCS lifecycle events and pushes changes to OJS automatically via an async queue with retries and daily reconciliation.

See [docs/plan.md](./docs/plan.md) for the full implementation plan. See [docs/discovery.md](./docs/discovery.md) for the decision trail and why alternatives were eliminated.

### What was eliminated and why

| Approach | Why it's dead |
|---|---|
| Native REST API sync | API has no subscription endpoints. Not in 3.4, 3.5, or main. |
| OIDC SSO | Only solves login, not access. Plugin has unresolved bugs, no 3.5 release, breaks multi-journal. |
| Pull-verify (Subscription SSO plugin) | Source code audit confirmed it hijacks OJS purchase flow. Non-members can't buy content. |
| XML user import | OJS built-in import creates user accounts only, not subscriptions. Paywall checks subscriptions table, so doesn't grant access. |

### How it works

```
Initial bulk sync (launch)
  → WP-CLI reads all active WCS subscriptions
  → For each member: calls OJS to find-or-create user + create subscription
  → Sends "set your password" welcome email
  → Member visits OJS, sets password → paywall sees subscription → access granted

Member signs up / renews on WordPress (ongoing)
  → WCS status changes to active → WP plugin queues sync
  → WP Cron calls OJS: find-or-create user + create subscription
  → OJS paywall sees subscription → access granted

Member lapses / cancels / payment fails
  → WCS status changes → WP plugin queues expire
  → WP Cron calls OJS: expire subscription
  → OJS paywall denies access → shows purchase options

Non-member visits paywalled content
  → No subscription → normal OJS purchase flow (£3 / £25 / £18)
```

## Access Model

| User type | How they access journal content |
|---|---|
| SEA member (current) | Subscription created in OJS via sync; logs into OJS separately |
| Non-member, single article | Buys via OJS paywall (£3) |
| Non-member, current issue | Buys via OJS paywall (£25) |
| Non-member, back issue | Buys via OJS paywall (£18) |
| Lapsed member | Subscription expired in OJS; treated as non-member |

## Key Constraints

- **Over budget, time-sensitive** — ship the simplest thing that works
- **WP is source of truth** — OJS subscriptions are derived, not authoritative
- **OJS paywall must keep working** — non-member purchases are revenue
- **No OJS core modifications** — plugins only
- **No OIDC/OpenID SSO** — only solves login, not access; OJS plugin poorly maintained against 3.5 breaking changes; if it fails, nobody can log into OJS at all

## Tech Stack

- WordPress (PHP) — existing SEA site, using Ultimate Member + WooCommerce + WooCommerce Subscriptions
- OJS (PHP) — journal hosting (currently 3.4.0-9, upgrade to 3.5 required)
- Custom OJS plugin (`sea-subscription-api`) — exposes subscription CRUD endpoints
- Custom WP plugin (`sea-ojs-sync`) — hooks into WooCommerce Subscriptions events, syncs to OJS
