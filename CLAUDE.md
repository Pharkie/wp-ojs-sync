# CLAUDE.md

## Project

WordPress ↔ OJS integration. WP manages memberships via WooCommerce Subscriptions; OJS hosts a journal behind a paywall. Goal: members get access automatically, non-members can still buy content.

## Key docs (read these first)

- `docs/plan.md` — implementation plan: what we're building, how it works, endpoint specs, launch sequence, testing approach
- `docs/discovery.md` — decision trail: what was tried, what was eliminated, and why
- `docs/review-findings.md` — multi-perspective plan review and how findings were resolved
- `docs/ojs-api.md` — OJS REST API capabilities, DB schema, PHP internals
- `docs/wp-integration.md` — WP membership stack (Ultimate Member + WooCommerce Subscriptions), hooks, code patterns
- `docs/janeway-paywall-investigation.md` — concrete technical plan for Janeway backup path
- `TODO.md` — roadmap with phased implementation steps

## Architecture decision

**Push-sync** (custom OJS plugin + WP plugin). A plugin on each side: the OJS plugin exposes REST endpoints for user and subscription CRUD (OJS has no native subscription API). The WP plugin calls those endpoints. Two modes of operation:

1. **Initial bulk sync:** WP-CLI command reads all active WooCommerce Subscriptions, creates OJS user accounts and subscription records for each member via the OJS plugin endpoints, then sends "set your password" welcome emails. This is how existing members get access at launch.
2. **Ongoing sync (after launch):** WP plugin hooks into WooCommerce Subscription lifecycle events (active, expired, cancelled, on-hold) and pushes changes to OJS automatically via an async queue.

See `docs/plan.md` for full details, `docs/discovery.md` for how we got here.

**Janeway migration** is a genuine backup (not a nuclear option) if the OJS 3.5 upgrade proves too costly. See `docs/discovery.md` for the comparison.

## Plan naming

| Name | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **OIDC SSO** | OpenID Connect SSO | Eliminated |
| **Pull-verify** | Subscription SSO plugin (OJS asks WP at access time) | Eliminated |
| **Push-sync** | WP pushes to OJS via plugins on each side | **Chosen** |
| **Push-sync (direct DB)** | Same but writes to OJS DB directly | Fallback |
| **XML user import** | OJS built-in XML import (users only, not subscriptions) | Eliminated |
| **Janeway migration** | Replace OJS with Janeway + custom paywall | Genuine backup |

## Hard constraints

- **WP is source of truth** for membership. OJS is downstream.
- **Email is the matching key.** Same email required on both systems. No separate mapping table. Members who want a different email on OJS must update their WP email first.
- **Bulk sync creates OJS accounts.** Don't wait for members to self-register. Push user accounts + subscriptions from WP upfront (existing members at launch).
- **OJS paywall must keep working** for non-member purchases (article, issue, back issue).
- **No OJS core modifications.** Plugins only.
- **Ship fast.** Prefer boring, reliable solutions.

## Eliminated approaches (don't revisit)

- **OIDC SSO** — only solves login not access; OJS plugin has unresolved bugs, no 3.5 release, breaks multi-journal.
- **Pull-verify** (Subscription SSO plugin) — source code audit confirmed it hijacks OJS purchase flow. Non-members can't buy content. See `docs/phase0-sso-plugin-audit.md`.
- **Native REST API sync** — subscription endpoints don't exist in any OJS version. Push-sync works around this with a custom OJS plugin.
- **XML user import** — creates user accounts only, not subscriptions. Roles that bypass the paywall are editorial/admin (inappropriate for members, no expiry control). No "subscriber" role exists. See `docs/xml-import-evaluation.md`.

## Gotchas

- **OJS has NO subscription REST API.** The endpoints don't exist. That's why we need a custom OJS plugin. See `docs/ojs-api.md`.
- **User creation API is unconfirmed.** Swagger spec shows read-only user endpoints. Verify against actual OJS version before relying on it.
- **Apache + PHP-FPM strips Authorization headers.** Need `CGIPassAuth on` in `.htaccess`. Do not use `?apiToken=` query param in production (leaks key into access logs).
- **OJS 3.5 upgrade is the biggest risk.** The 3.5 upgrade has significant breaking changes (Slim->Laravel, Vue 2->3). If this goes badly, re-evaluate Janeway migration.

## WP membership stack

**Ultimate Member + WooCommerce + WooCommerce Subscriptions.** UM handles registration/profiles/roles. WCS handles billing. Membership = WP role.

Primary integration: hook into **WooCommerce Subscriptions** status events (`woocommerce_subscription_status_active`, `_expired`, `_cancelled`, `_on-hold`). All sync calls are async (queued via Action Scheduler, not inline). Daily reconciliation catches any drift. See `docs/wp-integration.md` for WCS hook details and `docs/plan.md` for the full WP plugin spec.

## Code conventions

- WordPress plugin standards (PHP)
- Prefix everything `wpojs_`
- Use WP HTTP API (`wp_remote_post` etc.) — not raw cURL
- Use Action Scheduler for async jobs and retries
- Log all sync operations — failures must be visible in WP admin
- API key stored as `wp-config.php` constant (`WPOJS_API_KEY`), not in the database
- Settings page for OJS URL, subscription type mapping (WooCommerce Product -> OJS Subscription Type), journal ID(s)

## Don't

- Modify OJS source code
- Sync passwords between systems
- Build message queues, webhook servers, or microservices
- Add features beyond the core sync requirement
- Assume any OJS API endpoint exists without checking `docs/ojs-api.md`
- Revisit OIDC SSO or Pull-verify — both eliminated with documented reasons
