# CLAUDE.md

## Project

WordPress ↔ OJS integration. WP manages memberships via WooCommerce Subscriptions; OJS hosts a journal behind a paywall. Goal: members get access automatically, non-members can still buy content. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture, plugin descriptions, and decision trail.

## Key docs

## The WordPress here is a test rig, not a future site

**Decided 2026-07-29.** The `wp` / `wp-db` services on the box
(`wp-staging.*`, basic-auth gated, `noindex`) exist for one reason: to exercise
the WP↔OJS integration before a change reaches the live WordPress. They are
**never** going to be promoted to the real site — Harbour replaces WordPress,
and the migration this mirror was built for is not being resumed.

They are kept anyway, and should be, because the integration they test is still
in production: the live WP on Krystal runs the sync until Harbour cut-over.
Deleting the rig would leave that with nowhere to rehearse.

So: keep it working, don't invest in it, and don't confuse it with live.
**Live WordPress is on Krystal, reached as `sea-wp-live`** — never the box. Once
cut-over completes and the sync is retired, the rig and its smoke-test sections
(1, 1b, 3, 6, 7, 9) can go.

## Asking for a decision — 🛑 HARD RULE

**When the work needs a decision that is Adam's, ask it as an interactive
question, in the turn the need arises.** Not "say the word", not "if you want X
I can" — those read as narration and are invisible, so the work stalls while
Claude believes it has handed over. Put the context in the question and its
options, lead with a recommendation, and say what each choice costs.

**Name things as Adam would recognise them.** An article is "The Twelve-Day War
Experience, by Rezgar Mohammadi (37.2, pp. 394–413)", never
`37.2/13-the-twelve-day-war-experience-...jats.xml` and never "37.2/13". Slugs
are how the pipeline addresses files, not how anyone thinks about the content.

Routine judgement calls are still Claude's to make and act on. Reporting
finished work stays prose — only the decision must be interactive.

## Good to know

- **OJS has NO subscription REST API.** The endpoints don't exist. That's why a custom OJS plugin is needed. See `docs/ojs-sync-plugin-api.md`.
- **OJS plugin uses `getInstallMigration()`**, not `getInstallSchemaFile()` (which is `final` in OJS 3.5). See `WpojsApiLogMigration.php`.
- **OJS plugin folder must be `wpojsSubscriptionApi`** (camelCase). Hyphens/underscores break autoloading and the Plugins admin page. See `docs/non-docker-setup.md`.
- **Apache + PHP-FPM strips Authorization headers.** Need `CGIPassAuth on` in `.htaccess`. Do not use `?apiToken=` query param in production (leaks key into access logs).
- **OJS 3.5 stores galley labels in `publication_galleys.label` column**, not in `publication_galley_settings`. Inserting label rows into the settings table causes `getLabel()` to return a localized array instead of a string, breaking label comparisons (e.g. inline HTML plugin's `=== 'Full Text'` check).
- **Haiku extraction can drop repeated/multilingual content.** Haiku may treat transliterated references (e.g. Cyrillic then Latin script) as duplicates and omit one set. The prompt now explicitly says to include both, but always verify HTML galleys against source PDFs for articles with non-English references.
- **OJS 3.5 upgrade is the biggest risk.** The 3.5 upgrade has significant breaking changes (Slim→Laravel, Vue 2→3). If this goes badly, re-evaluate Janeway migration.
- **WP usernames are synced to OJS** but sanitized to lowercase-alphanumeric (OJS constraint). WP usernames commonly contain dots, hyphens, underscores, spaces, or `@` — these get stripped, so typing the WP login into OJS may not match. Mitigated: the login page relabels the field to "Email" and sets `autocomplete="email"`. OJS login auto-detects email-shaped input and does email lookup. See `docs/ojs-sync-plugin-api.md#username-sync`.
- **`rebuildSearchIndex.php` queues jobs, never indexes inline** (OJS 3.5). Always drain the queue with `scripts/ojs/blast-queue.sh` (or `jobs.php run --once`) after. Never `DELETE FROM jobs` after a rebuild. See `docs/ojs-issues-log.md` #25.
- **Whole-issue PDF galleys duplicate every article's content.** Any article content correction must also be applied to the issue PDF: `pipe9_issue_galleys.sh --replace [--host=sea-live] <issue dir>` swaps the file behind the existing galley in place (pipe7 `--force` never touches it). Corrected versions differing from the staged input belong in the `backfill/private/output/<vol.iss>/issue-galley.pdf` presave slot, which both pipe6 and pipe9 prefer over the input. See `docs/ojs-issues-log.md` #37.
- **Unpublishing an OJS issue takes every article in it offline AND de-indexes them all from search.** Nothing is deleted — restore is SQL status flips (`issues.published=1`, `publications.status=3`, `submissions.status=3`) plus a full `rebuildSearchIndex.php` + drain; there is no per-issue reindex. Editors should edit published articles in place, never unpublish the issue. See `docs/ojs-issues-log.md` #33.
- **Smarter Similar Articles plugin** (`smarterSimilarArticles` slug, `plugins/smarter-similar-articles/` folder) replaces the stock `recommendBySimilarity` (which is disabled — it collapses on this thematically narrow corpus; see `docs/ojs-issues-log.md` #26). Rebuild the cache with `python3 scripts/ojs/build_smarter_similar_articles.py --target=dev|live` (hybrid TF-IDF + embeddings, ~2.5 min for ~1400 articles). Nightly GH Actions workflow rebuilds against live automatically. Full docs: `docs/smarter-similar-articles-plugin.md`.

## Backfill pipeline

🛑 **The content half of this pipeline is no longer here.** On 2026-08-18 the stages that turn an issue PDF into per-article PDFs, HTML, JATS and citations moved to Harbour, `membership-platform/scripts/pipeline/`, and were deleted from this repo. What remains is **delivery into OJS only**: `pipe6`–`pipe13`. Generate an issue over there, then run these against the same output folder.

Imports journal back-issues into OJS. See [`docs/backfill-reference.md`](docs/backfill-reference.md) for command reference and [`docs/archive-checker-plugin.md`](docs/archive-checker-plugin.md) for the QA workflow. Generation: `membership-platform/scripts/pipeline/README.md`.

Structure: `backfill/html_pipeline/` (OJS delivery, pipe6–pipe13), `backfill/lib/` (`crossref.py`, `doi_validate.py`, `paths.py`).

**`lib/paths.py` is what lets these stages read a folder Harbour generated.** `toc.json` records `split_pdf` relative to the repository root that wrote it, so a Harbour-generated folder points at `./scripts/pipeline/private/...`, which resolves to nothing here. `load_toc()` resolves each split PDF beside its own toc.json. Every stage that reads a toc must load it that way — a bare `json.load` reintroduces the break, and `backfill/tests/test_paths_interop.py` fails if one does.

**Publishing a NEW issue is a different path** — see [`docs/new-issue-runbook.md`](docs/new-issue-runbook.md). Its generation steps are now Harbour's; the OJS half is unchanged. DOIs are minted after import by `pipe11_assign_dois.sh` and then written back into JATS by `tools/snapshot_ids.py`; `pipe8_restore.py` is skipped on the first import because there are no prior IDs to restore.

### Gotchas

- **JATS is the single source of truth** for all per-article data (DOIs, publisher-IDs, page numbers, citations, body content). No registries. `pipe6_ojs_xml.py` reads everything from JATS.
- **toc.json `authors` field** is always a string (e.g. `"Emmy van Deurzen & Michael R. Montgomery"`). Do not convert to list — 8+ downstream scripts expect string.
- **🛑 Check a volume reproduces before reprocessing it: `scripts/dev/check-idempotent.sh <vol.iss>`.** It regenerates from `raw.html`, diffs against git, and restores. A volume that does not reproduce has been fixed downstream at some point, so rerunning it silently undoes that fix and reinstates the original defect. This is not hypothetical: 12.1 turned five paragraphs of a book review into references that way (2026-08-10), and a corpus sweep found **47 of 70 volumes** in the same state — 53 articles carrying the *next* article's opening text, 96% of them book reviews sharing a page with the following review. `lib/postprocess.py` now cuts 40 of those 53 itself; the remaining **13 are known drift** (the printed header differs too much from the toc title) and are listed by the script. Live is correct for all of them — the risk is entirely in reprocessing.
- **Published-article amendments go through the pipeline, never the OJS UI or hand-edits to generated files.** Edit `raw.html`, set `_manual_html` in toc.json, rerun pipe2→pipe6, reimport the issue (`--force` + pipe8/9b/9c). Hand-edits to JATS/galleys are silently lost on the next rerun, and UI edits desync the other galleys, the issue PDF (#37), and the successor system. See `docs/support-runbook.md`. **Metadata-only corrections (author name, title) have a fast path** that skips the reimport and the reindex storm: `pipe13_patch_metadata.py` (+ `--galleys` for the article's own files, `pipe9_issue_galleys.sh --replace` for the issue PDF, `pipe12 --redeposit` for Crossref) — see `docs/new-issue-runbook.md` §1c. Author-name fixes must flip `backfill/private/authors.json` first or the split normaliser reverts them.
- **Haiku extraction can drop repeated/multilingual content.** Always verify HTML galleys against source PDFs for articles with non-English references.
- **Docker in devcontainer requires `sudo`** for `pipe7_import.sh` and `pipe8_restore.py` (they call `docker` directly). Other pipeline steps (pipe1–pipe6) don't need Docker. For `--target live`, do NOT use `sudo` — it breaks SSH config resolution. Only `--target dev` needs `sudo`.
- **pipe3 auto-reflows line-wrapped paragraphs.** The extractor sometimes emits one `<p>` per physical PDF line; `reflow_paragraphs.py` repairs this from the PDF's own wrap markers and **pipe3 now applies it to every JATS it writes** (added 2026-08-04 after the 93-article reflow of 2026-08-03 — applied to generated files only — was silently undone by the next regeneration). Never apply reflow as a one-off pass over outputs; anything not in the pipeline is lost on the next rerun. All its safety gates decline rather than guess.
- **Regeneration gotchas moved with the code.** `_manual_html`, "never run
  `pipe4` on its own", the reflow rule and the DOI cache are documented where
  those stages now live: `membership-platform/scripts/pipeline/README.md`.
- **Three HTML stages per article:** `.raw.html` (Haiku extraction), `.post.html` (post-processed), `.galley.html` (from JATS). No file collisions.
- **Three galleys per article in OJS:** PDF, HTML ("Full Text"), and JATS XML. All subject to the same paywall. JATS XML galley is for OAI-PMH harvesting, indexing, and preservation.
- **Citation classification is heading-driven.** Items under "References" → citations. Items under "Notes" → notes. The heading is the authority — no per-item promotion between categories. Bio/contact headings ("About the Author", "Author Bio", "Contact", "Author Information") → bios. Each item gets exactly 1 classification, never 0 or 2. Contact info is always part of bio.
- **DOI cache (`doi_matches.json`) keys on reference TEXT, not ref_id.** `ref_id` is a positional index that changes when citations are re-extracted. Text-based lookup is resilient to reordering. pipe4b also validates existing `<pub-id>` DOIs against ref text — won't trust stale JATS.
- **pipe9b DELETEs old `crossref::doi` rows** before INSERT — prevents accumulation across runs. pipe8 cleans orphaned citations from old imports.
- **pipe9b's wipe is scoped to the issues it is rewriting** (`scoped_publication_ids()`), so `--issue` is safe. It did not used to be: the DELETE was unconditional while `--issue` scoped only the INSERT, so `pipe9b --target live --issue 37.2 --confirm` wiped every reference DOI in the journal and wrote back only that issue's — 6,945 rows to 146, live, reporting "Done. 146 DOIs written" (2026-08-10, fixed same day, `test_pipe9b_scope.py`). It prints `Scope: N issue(s), M articles` before deleting; if that says 69 issues on a single-issue run, stop. Sanity check after any run: `SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT setting_value) FROM citation_settings WHERE setting_name='crossref::doi'` ≈ 6,945 / 4,506.

### QA iteration loop

1. Steps 1–5 are Harbour's now — fix the pipeline and regenerate there
   (`scripts/pipeline/README.md`; the run is pipe2 → pipe3 → pipe4 → pipe4b →
   pipe5 against the same output folder). **Run pipe2–pipe5 as a block**: pipe3
   rewrites the JATS from scratch and pipe4 expects exactly that state.
6. `python3 backfill/html_pipeline/pipe6_ojs_xml.py <toc.json>` (writes import.xml next to toc.json)
7. `sudo bash backfill/html_pipeline/pipe7_import.sh backfill/private/output/<vol.iss> --force` (~7 sec)
8. `sudo python3 backfill/html_pipeline/pipe8_restore.py --target dev --issue <vol.iss>` (~0.6 sec)
9. QA in browser — repeat from step 1 if issues found

**Per-issue iteration takes ~8 seconds.** Reprocess only affected volumes, not all 1400 articles — approved articles should not be regressed. Full reimport (`--wipe-articles`, ~20 min) only when all volumes need updating.

### Post-import scripts (post-QA, one-off)

Run after QA is complete and articles are finalized:

1. `python3 backfill/html_pipeline/pipe4b_match_dois.py --volume <vol.iss> --email EMAIL` — matches refs to Crossref DOIs, writes `<pub-id>` to JATS + `doi_matches.json`. See [`docs/crossref-reference-linking.md`](docs/crossref-reference-linking.md).
2. `sudo python3 backfill/html_pipeline/pipe9b_citation_dois.py --target dev` — writes matched DOIs from JATS to OJS `citation_settings` table (2 SQL calls, seconds). Requires pkp/crossrefReferenceLinking plugin for display.
3. `sudo python3 backfill/html_pipeline/pipe9c_content_filtered.py --target dev` — writes content-filtered flags from JATS `<custom-meta>` to OJS `publication_settings` table. Used by Archive Checker filter pill and article page warning.

### Content-filtered articles

Articles that couldn't be fully extracted (Haiku content-filtered, PyMuPDF fallback) are flagged through the full chain:

1. **JATS** (source of truth): `<custom-meta><meta-name>content-filtered</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta>` in `<article-meta>`. Written by pipe3 from `.post.html` `AUTO-EXTRACTED` comment or toc.json `_content_filtered` flag.
2. **Galley HTML**: `<div data-content-filtered="true">` prepended by pipe5 (reads from JATS).
3. **OJS DB**: `publication_settings` row (`setting_name='contentFiltered'`). Written by pipe9c (reads from JATS).
4. **Archive Checker**: filter pill excludes by default, warning banner on article. Queries DB.
5. **Article page**: warning notice. Queries DB.

To manually flag an article: set `_content_filtered: true` in toc.json, rerun pipe3→pipe9c.

### Deploying to live

Three scenarios, from lightest to heaviest.

#### Code-only changes (plugin code, CSS, JS, templates)

No article data changes — just updated plugin behaviour or UI.

1. `ssh sea-live 'cd /opt/pharkie-ojs-plugins && git pull'`
2. If docker-compose.yml changed (volume mounts, env vars): `docker compose up -d --force-recreate ojs`
3. `scripts/monitoring/content-check.sh --host=sea-live` — verify site still works

#### Specific issues changed (pipeline fix affecting some volumes)

Article data changed for specific volumes only. No need to reimport everything.

1. Reprocess affected volumes on dev: pipe2→pipe6 for each volume
2. Re-attach DOIs: run the DOI re-attachment script (reads `doi_matches.json`, writes to JATS)
3. Import to dev: `pipe7 --force` + `pipe8` for affected volumes, verify in Archive Checker
4. Better Stack: `scripts/monitoring/maintenance-window.sh --pause`
5. `scripts/dev/backfill-remote.sh --host=sea-live --sync-only` — sync import XMLs
6. `ssh sea-live` → `pipe7_import.sh <affected volumes> --force` — reimport just those issues (add `--no-reindex` if body text is unchanged — JATS/PDF/DOI-only changes aren't searchable text and the full rebuild can grind for ~20 min)
7. `pipe8_restore.py --target live --confirm`
8. `pipe9b_citation_dois.py --target live --confirm`
9. `pipe9c_content_filtered.py --target live --confirm`
10. Better Stack: `scripts/monitoring/maintenance-window.sh --resume`
11. `scripts/monitoring/content-check.sh --host=sea-live`

#### Full reimport (all 68 volumes)

Nuclear option — wipes all articles and reimports from scratch. Use when systemic pipeline changes affect all volumes, or for a clean deployment.

1. Full pipeline rerun on dev: pipe2→pipe6 for all volumes + DOI re-attachment
2. Import to dev: `pipe7 --force` + `pipe8` + `pipe9b` + `pipe9c`, verify
3. Better Stack: `scripts/monitoring/maintenance-window.sh --pause`
4. `scripts/dev/backfill-remote.sh --host=sea-live` — syncs + wipes + reimports all
5. `pipe8_restore.py --target live --confirm` — restores submission/issue IDs + DOI status
6. `pipe9b_citation_dois.py --target live --confirm` — writes citation DOIs
7. `pipe9c_content_filtered.py --target live --confirm` — writes content-filtered flags
8. Sync Archive Checker reviews: export from dev `archive_checker_reviews`, import to live
9. Better Stack: `scripts/monitoring/maintenance-window.sh --resume`
10. `scripts/monitoring/smoke-test.sh --host=sea-live` — infrastructure (28 checks)
11. `scripts/monitoring/content-check.sh --host=sea-live` — content (14 checks)

#### DOI re-attachment after pipeline reruns

pipe3 wipes JATS (including DOIs from pipe4b). After any pipe3+pipe4 rerun, DOIs must be re-attached from `doi_matches.json` before pipe5+pipe6. This is a Python script (not a pipeline step) that reads cached matches and writes `<pub-id>` elements back to JATS. Without this, DOIs are silently lost.

#### Notes

- `--force` reimports existing issues without wiping. `--wipe-articles` wipes first (preserves users/subscriptions/payments).
- `pipe8` is always needed after `--wipe-articles` or `--force` to restore original submission IDs and DOI registration status (preserves URLs, DOI links, payment records, prevents re-deposit).
- `pipe9b` and `pipe9c` are always needed after import — they write to DB tables that the import doesn't populate.
- **An import can REMOVE content, not just add it.** Everything an article carries beyond its title — galleys, citations, DOI, page numbers — is read from the files beside its `split_pdf` in toc.json. A path that doesn't resolve on the host you're running from produces a valid-looking `import.xml` with the articles hollowed out, and `pipe7 --force` then strips that content from the journal. This happened on 2026-08-03: three toc.json files still held absolute `/workspaces/...` devcontainer paths, so regenerating 36.1 on a Mac emitted 18 articles with no galleys and no citations, printed "XML valid: 18 articles", imported cleanly, and cost the issue all 54 galleys and 302 citations on dev. **pipe6 now errors instead of warning**, and all paths are relative. After any reimport, reconcile per-volume citation counts against the JATS rather than trusting a green run.
- **Stale files on disk are not part of the issue.** `toc.json` is the manifest; a `<slug>.jats.xml` that isn't listed there is a leftover from an earlier split or numbering and is never imported. 45 such files were removed on 2026-08-03. They matter because they inflate any count taken by globbing the output directory — which is exactly how the reconciliation above can look wrong when it isn't. `issue-galley.pdf` is NOT one of these: it's the presave slot for a corrected whole-issue PDF (#37).
- Archive Checker reviews survive `--wipe-articles` (custom table, not touched by import). But `publication_id` becomes stale — the `submission_id` column is what matters.
- **Better Stack monitors must be paused before any operation that causes downtime** — `scripts/monitoring/maintenance-window.sh --pause`, and `--resume` the moment the deploy is verified. `--status` says what is paused right now, which is the question worth being able to answer: a monitor left paused is worse than one that alerted, because the site is unwatched and nothing says so. Needs a valid `BETTERSTACK_API_TOKEN` in `private/.env.live` — the one stored there was rejected as invalid on 2026-08-03, so mint a fresh Team API token before relying on it.
- **One heavy job at a time.** The box is 2 vCPUs / 3.8 GB **plus a 3 GB swapfile** (added 2026-08-04, fstab-persisted, swappiness 10) running thirteen containers. The swap is real and load-bearing — typically ~1 GB of it is in use — so a "high swap usage" alert is the swapfile working, not pressure; a swap monitor wants a threshold like >50% or sustained swap I/O, never swap>0. It raises the ceiling; it does not make the box big. An issue import running alongside a CI-triggered Harbour deploy pinned both cores and took every vhost down — sshd included, so the only way in was `hcloud` (issues log #39). `gh run list --limit 1` in both repos before starting an import, and don't push while one is running.

### Data and tests

All journal-specific data lives in the private repo via symlink: `backfill/private` → `private/backfill/`. Regression tests: `python3 -m pytest backfill/tests/ -v`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the fixture-driven testing workflow.
