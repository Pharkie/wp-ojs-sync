# Setup Guide

Dev environment setup, secrets management, and devcontainer details. For Docker container setup, see [`docker-setup.md`](docker-setup.md). For VPS deployment, see [`vps-deployment.md`](vps-deployment.md).

## Dev environment scripts

- **`scripts/dev/rebuild-dev.sh`** — full grave-and-pave: tears down containers+volumes, rebuilds images, brings up stack, runs setup, runs tests. Devcontainer-only (hardcoded host path for DinD volume mounts). Flags: `--with-sample-data`, `--skip-tests`.
  - **For full dev environment with all content:** run `rebuild-dev.sh --with-sample-data --skip-tests` (seeds ~1400 test WP users + subscriptions), then `sudo bash backfill/html_pipeline/pipe7_import.sh backfill/private/output/* --wipe-articles` (imports all issues with HTML + PDF galleys). The `--wipe-articles` flag wipes existing issues/articles first (users/subscriptions/payments kept).
  - **For quick dev cycle:** `rebuild-dev.sh --with-sample-data` gives 2 sample issues + test users — enough for sync testing without the backfill wait.
- **`scripts/infra/setup.sh`** — unified setup for all environments. Assumes containers are already running. Flags: `--env=dev|staging|prod`, `--with-sample-data`. Sample data is always opt-in (never auto-included).
- **`scripts/infra/setup-dev.sh`** — thin shim, runs `setup.sh --env=dev`. Kept for backwards compatibility.

### Why two scripts?

Docker-in-Docker in the devcontainer requires the host path for `--project-directory` (volume mounts resolve against the host filesystem). `rebuild-dev.sh` is the outer script (tear down + build + setup). `setup.sh --env=dev` is the portable inner script. Staging/prod use plain `docker compose` on the VPS.

### DinD abstraction

`scripts/lib/dc.sh` provides `init_dc` which auto-detects DinD via `HOST_PROJECT_DIR` env var (set in `devcontainer.json` from `${localWorkspaceFolder}`). All scripts source it and use `$DC`. No hardcoded host paths anywhere.

### Devcontainer image (`.devcontainer/Dockerfile`)

The image includes Node.js, PHP CLI, Docker CLI, `gh`, Python + backfill libs (pymupdf, bs4, anthropic…), `ocrmypdf` + tesseract, Playwright system deps (chromium + webkit), SOPS + age, hcloud CLI, Claude Code CLI, and `ggshield` (user-level via `pipx`).

Layers are ordered **heavy → volatile** so small additions don't bust the expensive layers:

- The big apt/pip/npm layers are near the top (playwright deps, ocrmypdf, Claude CLI — minutes to rebuild).
- The **last RUN** is reserved for small/volatile apt packages. When adding a new package (e.g. `git-lfs`), append it to that final RUN, not the big one. Otherwise you invalidate every cached layer above it, turning a <10 s rebuild into a 3 min one.

`postCreateCommand` is kept short on purpose: chown the cache volumes, `npm install` (guarded by `cmp -s package-lock.json node_modules/.package-lock.json` — skipped when nothing changed), `playwright install chromium`, `setup-hooks.sh`, clone private repo. Anything stable should be baked into the image instead.

## Deployment scripts

- **`scripts/infra/init-vps.sh`** — one-time VPS setup (Hetzner): creates server, firewall, SSH config. Run once per server.
- **`scripts/infra/deploy.sh`** — deploys code to a VPS via SSH: git pull, build images, start containers, run setup. Run every time you ship code. Flags: `--host`, `--provision`, `--skip-setup`, `--skip-build`, `--ref`, `--clean`, `--env-file`.
- **`scripts/monitoring/smoke-test.sh`** — lightweight staging/prod health checks via SSH (curl + WP-CLI). Includes backup health checks.
- **`scripts/monitoring/load-test.sh`** — performance tests using `hey` with server resource monitoring.
- **`scripts/ojs/backup-ojs-db.sh`** — runs ON the VPS (via cron at 03:00 UTC). Dumps OJS DB + WP DB + Umami DB + OJS files volume → gzip → AES-256-CBC encrypt → rotate (DB: 7 daily + 4 weekly; files tarball: 1 daily + 2 weekly). Then calls the off-site step below.
- **`scripts/ojs/upload-backup-r2.sh`** — copies the encrypted `*.sql.gz.enc` dumps to Cloudflare R2 and expires old ones. See **Off-site backups** below.
- **`scripts/infra/pull-ojs-backup.sh`** — runs FROM devcontainer. Pull, list, decrypt backups. Also manages VPS cron (`--install-cron`, `--remove-cron`).

## Off-site backups

The dumps land on the VPS, and a VPS is one machine. The off-site copy goes to
**Cloudflare R2**, already AES-256-CBC encrypted — R2 holds the ciphertext, the
box holds the key (`/opt/backups/ojs/.backup-key`, plus the password-manager
copy). Neither one alone restores anything.

🛑 **This replaced a Git LFS push, and the reason is a trap worth naming.**
Until 2026-08-29 a GitHub Actions workflow in `Pharkie/sea-ojs-private`
committed each night's dump through Git LFS. The workflow pruned to 30 daily —
but **pruning a file does not free its LFS object**. 156 objects, 11.06 GB,
against a 10 GB account quota, and GitHub's documented way to reclaim it is to
delete the repository, because a history rewrite never touches the object store.
Any backup scheme whose "delete" does not free bytes will do this again. The
remediation for the 11 GB already there is in [`github-lfs-cleanup.md`](github-lfs-cleanup.md).

Configuration lives in the VPS's root-only `/opt/pharkie-ojs-plugins/.env`:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `BACKUP_R2_ENABLED` | `true` to switch it on. Anything else = skip, and say so in the log. |
| `BACKUP_R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account id. |
| `BACKUP_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `BACKUP_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | R2 **Object Read & Write** token for the backups bucket. |
| `BACKUP_R2_BUCKET` | A bucket of its own — **never the app's live bucket**, whose contents Harbour mirrors down onto its uploads volume nightly. Backups landing there would be pulled onto the box and tarred into Harbour's own backup. |
| `BACKUP_R2_JURISDICTION` | `eu` for an EU-jurisdiction bucket. Wrong value = an `AccessDenied` that reads like a bad key. |
| `BACKUP_R2_PREFIX` | Defaults to `ojs`. |

Retention in R2 is by age — 30 days daily, 84 days weekly — matching what the
LFS store held, so changing the storage did not quietly change the recovery
window. Two guards sit on the delete: it is skipped entirely below 7 objects,
and `--max-delete 10` aborts a run that wants to remove more than a night's
worth.

🛑 **rclone must be 1.65 or newer, and NOT the one in apt.** Ubuntu 24.04 ships
1.60.1, which cannot talk to R2 reliably: measured on the box, a 200 KB PUT
failed with `AccessDenied` six times out of six, while a hand-signed SigV4 PUT of
the same object with the same key succeeded three times out of three. Install the
upstream binary to `/usr/local/bin` (verify it against the release's
`SHA256SUMS`); the script checks the version and refuses to run on an older one.

**Not off-sited:** the ~4.3 GB `ojs-files-*.tar.gz.enc` galley tarball. The LFS
copy never carried it either. It is a cost decision rather than an oversight, and
it means a total loss of the box falls back to OJS's own files on the journal
host rather than to an off-site archive.

## Secrets management

Private docs and env files live in a **separate private GitHub repo**, cloned into `private/` (which is gitignored in the public repo). The devcontainer `postCreateCommand` auto-clones it on rebuild.

### What's in the private repo

- Markdown docs — plans, setup guides, review findings, checklists (unencrypted, no secrets)
- **`.env.live`** and **`.env.staging`** — SOPS-encrypted (contain all production/staging secrets: DB passwords, API keys, Stripe keys, SMTP creds)
- **`.sops.yaml`** — SOPS config with the age public key
- **`editorial-roles.json`** — OJS editorial team mapping

### How SOPS encryption works

`.env.live` and `.env.staging` are encrypted with [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops) using [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) as the backend. The files are JSON on disk (not plaintext key=value). You cannot `cat` them and read values — you must use `sops` to decrypt.

- **Encryption key**: age keypair. Public key in `private/.sops.yaml`. Private key at `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` (bind-mounted from host into devcontainer).
- **SOPS auto-discovers the age key** from `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` — no env vars needed.
- **If the age key is missing**, sops commands will fail with `could not decrypt`. The key must exist on the host machine at `~/.config/sops/age/` before the devcontainer is built.
- **macOS path quirk**: when running sops directly on macOS (i.e. *outside* the devcontainer), sops looks in `~/Library/Application Support/sops/age/keys.txt` first and only falls back to `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` if `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` is unset. The portable fix is to add `export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE="$HOME/.config/sops/age/keys.txt"` to your shell rc — that pins sops to the same path on both platforms. Verify with `age-keygen -y "$SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE"` — the output must equal the recipient in `private/.sops.yaml`.

### Common operations

```bash
# Read a value from encrypted env file
sops -d private/.env.live | grep OJS_ADMIN_PASSWORD

# Edit secrets interactively (decrypts in $EDITOR, re-encrypts on save)
sops private/.env.live

# Add/update a secret programmatically (4 steps):
#   1. Decrypt to temp file
sops -d private/.env.live > /tmp/.env.live.plain
#   2. Edit the plaintext (append, sed, etc.)
echo 'NEW_VAR=value' >> /tmp/.env.live.plain
#   3. Re-encrypt (input file MUST match .sops.yaml path_regex: .env.live or .env.staging)
cp /tmp/.env.live.plain /tmp/.env.live
sops -e --config private/.sops.yaml --input-type binary --output-type json /tmp/.env.live > /tmp/.env.live.enc
cp /tmp/.env.live.enc private/.env.live
#   4. Verify and clean up
sops -d private/.env.live | grep NEW_VAR
rm /tmp/.env.live*

# Deploy (deploy.sh auto-detects SOPS and decrypts before SCP)
scripts/infra/deploy.sh --host=<your-server> --ssl --env-file=.env.live

# Decrypt to a temp file (for manual inspection)
sops -d private/.env.live > /tmp/.env.live
# ... inspect ...
rm /tmp/.env.live

# Commit changes to the private repo (it's a separate git repo!)
cd private && git add -A && git commit -m "Update env" && git push
```

### Important: two git repos

`private/` is its own git repo (cloned from your private GitHub repo). It is NOT part of the public repo. To commit changes to private docs or env files:

```bash
cd private
git add -A && git commit -m "description" && git push
cd /workspaces/pharkie-ojs-plugins  # back to public repo
```

Running `git add` from the public repo root will NOT stage anything inside `private/` — it's gitignored and has its own `.git/`.

### Symlinks

`.env.live` and `.env.staging` at the repo root are **symlinks** to `private/.env.live` and `private/.env.staging`. This lets `deploy.sh --env-file=.env.live` work without knowing about the private repo. The symlinks point to encrypted files — deploy.sh detects SOPS format and auto-decrypts.

### First-time setup (new machine / fresh devcontainer)

If `private/` is missing or `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` doesn't exist:

```bash
# 1. Clone private repo (if not auto-cloned by postCreateCommand)
gh repo clone <your-org>/<private-repo> private

# 2. Create symlinks
ln -sf private/.env.live .env.live
ln -sf private/.env.staging .env.staging

# 3. Age key — get from password manager, save to:
mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age
# Paste the AGE-SECRET-KEY-... line into:
#   ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt

# 4. Verify
sops -d private/.env.live | head -3
```
