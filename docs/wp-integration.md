# WP Integration: Ultimate Member + WooCommerce Subscriptions

Last updated: 2026-02-17.

This doc covers the WP membership stack and the raw hooks available. For the full WP plugin spec (queue tables, CLI commands, cron schedule, admin pages), see [`plan.md`](./plan.md#wp-plugin-spec).

## Stack

SEA uses **Ultimate Member + WooCommerce + WooCommerce Subscriptions**:

- **Ultimate Member** — user registration, profiles, role management
- **WooCommerce** — e-commerce layer (products, orders, checkout)
- **WooCommerce Subscriptions** — recurring subscription billing, status management

Membership = WP role assignment. When a user buys a subscription via WooCommerce, WooCommerce Subscriptions manages the billing cycle and Ultimate Member assigns/removes the corresponding WP role.

## Hooks used for OJS sync

**WooCommerce Subscriptions hooks only.** These fire on subscription lifecycle events and are the sole trigger for OJS sync. UM role change hooks were considered as a secondary safety net but dropped — they double-fire alongside WCS hooks, fire for unrelated role changes, and add complexity. The daily reconciliation job catches any edge cases WCS hooks miss (e.g. admin manual role changes).

```php
// Subscription activated (new signup or reactivation)
// → Queue: find-or-create OJS user + create/renew subscription + welcome email (if new user)
add_action('woocommerce_subscription_status_active', 'sea_ojs_queue_activate');

// Subscription expired
// → Queue: expire OJS subscription
add_action('woocommerce_subscription_status_expired', 'sea_ojs_queue_expire');

// Subscription cancelled
// → Queue: expire OJS subscription
add_action('woocommerce_subscription_status_cancelled', 'sea_ojs_queue_expire');

// Subscription on hold (e.g. payment failed)
// → Queue: expire OJS subscription (immediate, no grace period)
add_action('woocommerce_subscription_status_on-hold', 'sea_ojs_queue_expire');
```

**Important: all hooks queue a sync intent, they do not make inline HTTP calls.** The WP Cron queue processor handles the actual OJS API calls asynchronously. This prevents OJS downtime from blocking WP checkout.

### Additional hooks

```php
// Email change — propagate to OJS so the email-as-key model stays in sync
// → Queue: update OJS user email (old email → new email)
add_action('profile_update', 'sea_ojs_queue_email_change', 10, 3);

// User deletion — GDPR erasure propagation
// → Queue: delete/anonymise OJS user account
add_action('deleted_user', 'sea_ojs_queue_delete_user');
```

## WC_Subscription object

The `$subscription` object passed to WCS hooks is a `WC_Subscription` instance. Key methods:

- `$subscription->get_user_id()` — WP user ID
- `$subscription->get_status()` — `active`, `on-hold`, `cancelled`, `expired`, `pending-cancel`
- `$subscription->get_date('end')` — expiry date (Y-m-d H:i:s, or `0` if non-expiring)
- `$subscription->get_date('next_payment')` — next billing date
- `$subscription->get_items()` — line items (products purchased)

## Getting user data for OJS sync

```php
$user_id = $subscription->get_user_id();
$user = get_userdata($user_id);

// For OJS user find-or-create:
$email     = $user->user_email;
$firstname = $user->first_name;
$lastname  = $user->last_name;

// For OJS subscription dates:
$date_end = $subscription->get_date('end'); // Y-m-d H:i:s or 0 if non-expiring
// Non-expiring (0) → pass dateEnd = null to OJS endpoint
```

## Multiple subscriptions per member

A member can have multiple active WCS subscriptions (e.g. overlapping tiers during an upgrade). The sync logic resolves to **one OJS subscription per member per journal**:

- If **any** active WCS subscription exists → OJS subscription is active
- OJS `date_end` = **latest** end date across all active WCS subscriptions
- All tiers grant the same OJS access, so subscription type differences don't matter

```php
// Resolve across all active subscriptions for a user:
$subscriptions = wcs_get_subscriptions([
    'subscription_status' => 'active',
    'customer_id' => $user_id,
]);
$latest_end = null;
foreach ($subscriptions as $sub) {
    $end = $sub->get_date('end');
    if ($end === 0 || $end === '') {
        $latest_end = null; // non-expiring wins
        break;
    }
    if ($latest_end === null || $end > $latest_end) {
        $latest_end = $end;
    }
}
```

## Mapping membership tiers to OJS subscription types

**All membership tiers grant journal access**, but there are **multiple WooCommerce Subscription products** (e.g. different tiers like student, full, etc.). Any active subscription triggers OJS access regardless of tier.

The WP plugin settings page includes a mapping table: WooCommerce Product ID → OJS Subscription Type ID. Even though all tiers grant access, the mapping keeps things explicit and supports future differentiation if needed.

```php
// Check which product the subscription is for:
$items = $subscription->get_items();
foreach ($items as $item) {
    $product_id = $item->get_product_id();
    // Look up OJS subscription type from settings mapping
}
```

## Bulk sync

WP-CLI command only (not admin button — avoids HTTP timeouts). See [`plan.md`](./plan.md#wp-cli-commands) for the full command spec.

```php
// Core query for bulk sync:
$subscriptions = wcs_get_subscriptions(['subscription_status' => 'active']);
// Then iterate in batches of 50 with 500ms delay between API calls
```

`wcs_get_subscriptions()` is the WooCommerce Subscriptions helper function for querying subscriptions.

## UM hooks: why they were dropped

Ultimate Member role change hooks (`um_after_member_role_upgrade`, `um_after_user_role_is_updated`, etc.) were originally planned as a secondary safety net. They were dropped because:

1. **Double-firing**: WCS status changes trigger UM role changes, so both hooks fire for the same event — duplicate OJS API calls
2. **False positives**: UM hooks fire for role changes unrelated to membership (admin actions, other plugins)
3. **Complexity**: would need dedup logic (timestamp checks, action comparison) to avoid noise
4. **Unnecessary**: daily reconciliation catches anything WCS hooks miss. For immediate manual grants, use `wp sea-ojs sync --user=<email>`.

The UM hooks are documented here for reference in case the decision is revisited. The raw hook signatures:

```php
add_action('um_after_member_role_upgrade', function($new_roles, $old_roles, $user_id) {}, 10, 3);
add_action('um_when_status_is_set', function($user_id) {}, 10, 1);
add_action('um_after_user_role_is_updated', function($user_id, $role) {}, 10, 2);
```
