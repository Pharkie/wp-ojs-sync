# Hosting Requirements

What we need to deploy, test, and maintain the WP-OJS sync integration.

---

## OJS hosting (new — we can specify)

OJS is a fresh deployment. The dev environment runs OJS in Docker, and production should match that as closely as possible.

### Recommended setup

Run OJS as a Docker container on a Linux VPS. This mirrors the dev environment exactly and makes upgrades, backups, and troubleshooting straightforward.

**Minimum spec:** 2 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 25 GB SSD. OJS is a PHP/MySQL app with light traffic (~700 members, not concurrent). This is comfortable for staging and production. Scale up if article traffic grows significantly.

### What we need

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **SSH access** | Deploy plugin files, edit `config.inc.php`, restart services, troubleshoot |
| **Docker + Docker Compose** | Run OJS the same way as dev — reproducible, easy upgrades |
| **Root or sudo** | Manage containers, install packages, configure firewall |
| **MariaDB/MySQL access** | Not for normal operations (the plugin uses the OJS API), but essential for troubleshooting sync issues, verifying data, and running the `/preflight` health check |
| **Firewall control** | OJS needs to accept traffic on port 443 (HTTPS). The API IP allowlist is handled in `config.inc.php`, but the server firewall should also be configured |
| **SSL/TLS certificate** | HTTPS required — the WP plugin rejects `http://` URLs. Let's Encrypt via Caddy or nginx reverse proxy |
| **SMTP relay** | Transactional email (Mailgun, SES, or Postmark) with SPF/DKIM/DMARC configured for the OJS sending domain. Required for welcome emails and password resets |
| **DNS control** | Point the journal subdomain at the server, configure MX/SPF/DKIM records for email |
| **Automated backups** | Database + uploaded files. Daily, retained for 30 days minimum |

### Docker architecture

The production Docker setup would be similar to dev but simplified (no sample data, no dev tools):

```
docker-compose.yml
├── ojs          # OJS 3.5 (Apache + PHP-FPM)
├── ojs-db       # MariaDB
└── caddy/nginx  # Reverse proxy with SSL termination
```

The OJS plugin is mounted into the container (or built into the image). Config is managed via `config.inc.php` mounted as a volume.

### What an OJS upgrade looks like

1. Pull new OJS image / rebuild container
2. Run `wp ojs-sync test-connection` from WP (calls `/preflight` to verify plugin compatibility)
3. If preflight passes: done
4. If preflight fails: check which classes/methods changed, update plugin, re-test

This is why Docker matters — you can test the upgrade on staging by rebuilding the container, verify everything works, then do the same on production. No manual PHP/Apache upgrades.

### What we do NOT need

- cPanel, Plesk, or any control panel (SSH is sufficient and preferred)
- Shared hosting (OJS needs its own server/container)
- Windows (OJS runs on Linux)

## WP hosting (existing — what access we need)

WP is on existing hosting. We don't need to change the hosting setup, but we need specific access to deploy and configure the sync plugin.

### Access required

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **SSH access** | Deploy plugin files, run WP-CLI commands (bulk sync, test connection, reconciliation) |
| **WP-CLI** | All sync operations are WP-CLI commands. Without it, bulk sync and troubleshooting become much harder. Most hosts have it or it can be installed. |
| **WP Admin access** (Administrator role) | Configure plugin settings (OJS URL, type mapping), view sync log, test connection |
| **`wp-config.php` edit access** | Add `WPOJS_API_KEY` constant. This is a one-time change. |
| **File upload to `wp-content/plugins/`** | Deploy the `wpojs-sync` plugin. Can be done via SSH, SFTP, or WP Admin plugin upload. |
| **Outbound HTTPS from WP server** | WP needs to reach the OJS server on port 443. Some managed hosts restrict outbound connections — verify this works. |

### What we do NOT need

- Direct database access (all WP operations go through WP-CLI and the WP plugin API)
- Root/sudo access
- PHP version changes (plugin works with PHP 7.4+, which any current WP host supports)
- Server configuration changes (no Apache/nginx changes needed on the WP side)

### WP server IP

The OJS API uses an IP allowlist. We need to know the WP server's outbound IP address. The plugin settings page displays this, or run:

```bash
wp eval 'echo file_get_contents("https://api.ipify.org");' --allow-root
```

This IP goes into OJS `config.inc.php` under `[wpojs] allowed_ips`.

### Verifying access

Once we have access, the first thing to run:

```bash
# Check WP-CLI works
wp --info

# Check outbound connectivity to OJS (replace with actual OJS URL)
wp eval 'echo wp_remote_retrieve_response_code(wp_remote_get("https://journal.example.org/api/v1/wpojs/ping"));'

# Deploy plugin and test
wp ojs-sync test-connection
```

---

## Cross-provider connectivity

OJS and WP do not need to be on the same host, network, or data centre. The entire integration is authenticated HTTPS requests over the public internet — the same way WP already talks to Stripe, payment gateways, and other external services.

Configuration needed:

1. **WP side:** Set the OJS URL in plugin settings and add `WPOJS_API_KEY` to `wp-config.php`
2. **OJS side:** Add the WP server's outbound IP to `allowed_ips` in `config.inc.php` and set the same API key

The `test-connection` command verifies end-to-end connectivity, auth, and IP allowlisting in one step.

## Staging vs production

Both environments need the same access. Deploy to staging first, smoke test with a few users, then repeat on production.

| Step | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy OJS plugin | Yes | After staging verified |
| Deploy WP plugin | Yes | After staging verified |
| Configure both sides | Yes | Same config, different URLs/IPs/keys |
| `test-connection` | Yes | Yes |
| Sync 5-10 test users | Yes | Skip (go straight to dry-run) |
| `sync --dry-run` | Yes | Yes |
| `sync` (bulk) | Yes | After dry-run reviewed |
| `send-welcome-emails` | Test with 1-2 addresses | After bulk sync verified |

The launch sequence in [`plan.md`](./plan.md) has the full checklist.

## SEA-specific: Krystal (WP) + DigitalOcean (OJS)

SEA's WordPress is hosted on Krystal shared hosting. OJS has an existing staging instance but hasn't gone live yet — this is the right time to set up hosting that gives us the access we need. The recommended setup is OJS on a DigitalOcean droplet (London region), with WP staying on Krystal.

### Krystal vs WP requirements

| Requirement | Krystal shared hosting | Status |
|---|---|---|
| SSH access | Yes (all plans except Amethyst) | Met |
| WP-CLI | Yes — installed by default | Met |
| WP Admin access | Yes | Met |
| `wp-config.php` edit | Yes — via SSH or cPanel file manager | Met |
| File upload to plugins dir | Yes — SSH, SFTP, or cPanel | Met |
| Outbound HTTPS | Yes — not restricted | Met |

Krystal does not offer root access, Docker, or VPS-level control on shared plans — but none of that is needed for WP. No migration required.

### DigitalOcean vs OJS requirements

| Requirement | DigitalOcean droplet | Status |
|---|---|---|
| SSH access | Yes — root by default | Met |
| Docker + Docker Compose | Yes — one-click Docker image available, or install manually | Met |
| Root or sudo | Yes | Met |
| MariaDB/MySQL access | Yes — runs in Docker container | Met |
| Firewall control | Yes — UFW on server + DigitalOcean cloud firewall | Met |
| SSL/TLS certificate | Yes — Let's Encrypt via Caddy or nginx | Met |
| DNS control | Yes — DigitalOcean DNS or external | Met |
| Automated backups | Yes — droplet backups (~$2.40/mo) or manual snapshots | Met |

**Cost:** ~$12/mo (~£10/mo) for the production droplet + ~$2.40/mo for automated backups. Staging doesn't need to run 24/7 — snapshot the droplet and destroy it when not in use, restore from snapshot when needed (takes a few minutes). Snapshot storage is ~$0.05/GB/mo, so a 25 GB staging snapshot costs ~$1.25/mo idle vs $12/mo running.

**SMTP relay** and **OJS config** are configured by us on the droplet, not provided by DigitalOcean.

### Why this split works

- WP stays where it is — zero migration risk, zero downtime
- OJS gets the Docker/root/DB access it needs on a clean VPS
- Both in UK data centres (Krystal: UK, DigitalOcean: London)
- Standard HTTPS between them — no special networking
- Total additional hosting cost: ~£15/mo (production droplet + backups + idle staging snapshot)
